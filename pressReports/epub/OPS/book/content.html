      <h1 id='p1'>New Book Editions for 2013 Products</h1>
      <p>Microsoft has updated Project, Project Server, and SharePoint. We need
        to produce new editions of our books in order to remain relevant, to 
        cover the new features available, and to provide solutions to the 
        depricated features.</p>
      <p>Under the management of Pam Greensky, the first, preliminary editions 
        <cite>Introduction to Scheduling with Microsoft Project</cite> and 
        <cite>Advanced Scheduling with Microsoft Project</cite> have been written. 
        Project MVPs Cindy Lewis, Ellen Lehnert, and Tim Runcie will still need
        to perform a thorough functional review and check spelling and grammar.</p>
      <p>Tim is currently working on the <cite>Project Server Administrator's 
        Guide</cite> book. Cindy will begin working on the <cite>Project Server 
        Project Manager's Guide</cite> before the end of the month.</p>

        <h2 id='p1.c1'>New Initiatives</h2>
        <p>All of our books have now been modularized. This allows us to quickly 
          spice together cutsom books from multiple modules (and to distribute 
          modules independent of larger works).</p>
        <p>Based off of our proof printings of the preliminary editions of the 
          Project 2013 books, we're refining the page layout Advisicon 2.0 books.</p>
        <p>As we are cleaning up the layout of our printed books, we're also working
          on our digital distribution capabilities with ebooks. To do this, we 
          have instituted a writing template for our authors, are improving the
          code generation afforded by our layout software, and are designing a
          mobile specific layout.</p>

        <h2 id='p1.c2'>Sales</h2>
        <p>We had a wonderful outlier in January: a high count and high sales. 
          Since then, things have been slower, but relatively steady.</p>
        <p>The highest count performers were beginner's books: <cite>PPM</cite>,
          <cite>Project</cite>, and <cite>Team Member Project Server</cite>.</p>
