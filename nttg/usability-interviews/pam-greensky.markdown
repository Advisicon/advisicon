# User Observations

This document describes the insights our team has learned about 
[http://nttg.biz]() to date through usability interviews and observations of 
current user interactions with the website.

We have interviewed two website administrators, one NTTG executive, and one
NTTG funder. We have also briefly researched the functional capabilities of a 
user type not interviewed, the private access user. 

## User Types

There are three different types of users (plus some special cases) accessing 
the website: administrative users, private access users, and public users. 
Administrative users handle the day to day content maintenance of the site. 
Public users have access to information that must be legally made available 
(meeting notes, contact information, and a list of upcoming meetings). Private 
access users have access to all of the public content, plus private content. 

### Administrative Users

There are very few regular administrative users of the website. These administrative 
users are frustrated with the difficulties posed by a counter intuitive interface. 
Often, they need to use multiple browser windows to capture the relevant structural 
and hierarchical information in order to make updates to the site. In order to 
create hyperlinks that reference the correct URI, administrative users must use 
multiple browser windows and a pop-up dialog.

The admin taxonomy does not map well to the administrative users' expectations. 
For example, the admin interface contains a location for "Files" and a location 
for "Documents," but the difference between the two types are not clear.

Navigation of the administrative interface is an entirely different experience 
than navigation of the website front end.

Rather than relying on familiarity with website administration and maintenance 
to keep the website up and running, administrators must rely on an extensive 
collection of self-created, locally saved support documents. Each administrator 
may have a different set of documentation or documentation with differing 
instructions.

### Private Access Users

Note: we have not interviewed any private access users.

While private access users could feasibly access content that was not available 
to the general public, no such content is currently being added to the site. 
As a result, private access users have access to no more content than public 
users.

### Public Users

We have not interviewed any public users.

Public users only have access to content that is published for availability on 
the website front end.

### Notable Cross-Type Users

There are a few notable users that fall into two or more of the user type
categories.

#### Other NTTG Staff

While some of the NTTG staff are administrative users, not all are. Despite 
restricted access (at the user permissions level), the NTTG staff has significant
authority to influence the layout, design, information structure, and content
of nttg.biz. Without a position at NTTG, these staff members would be limited 
to the same influence that a Public Access User holds.

To initiate updates, non-administrative users at NTTG communicate directly with 
the administrative users (via phone calls or email) to direct the administrators
through the changes step-by-step.

# Technology

Of the users we interviewed, only a small selection of browsers were used to 
access nttg.biz:

* Microsoft Internet Explorer **version????** (IE**version#**)
* Google Chrome

The only users observed accessing nttg.biz with IE were the administrative 
users. All other users used Chrome.

Administrative users did not prefer IE to Chrome; instead, their reason for 
using IE was purely functional: the nttg.biz administration interace is not 
compatible with modern browsers. When using modern browsers with the 
administration interface, the creation, update, and removal of content fails.

The limited nttg.biz browser compatability also limits the software and 
operating systems that the administrators must have access to in order to 
maintain the website.

# Content Types

There are four different types of content currently being added to the website: 
images, text, Adobe Acrobat files, and datetime information.

## Images

Only two images are currently used on the website. One is the header image 
(bus_header.jpg) and the other is a map of NTTG's coverage area (nttg_map_final_xxlarge.jpg). 
The coverage map is the only image that is ever updated. It is an inline image 
placed within a WYSIWYG text box.

This image is updated slightly less often than the text, every two years or more.

## Text

A large portion of the content on the website is text. The text is updated by 
administrative users. They first log in through the front end and then perform 
their edits within WYSIWYG text boxes and single line text boxes.

This data is updated "maybe once every two years."

## Adobe Acrobat Files

This may be the most frequently updated content. These are meeting notes and 
proposals. Before being made available to public users, the administrative users 
must first receive sign-off from stakeholders. In some cases stakeholders may 
have private access accounts, but these accounts do not grant them early access 
to content.

Correctly uploading, storing, and including these files on the website is a 
difficult, time consuming process.

The current process for uploading meeting notes is as follows:

1. While the meeting occurs a note taker takes notes. In most cases the note 
   taker is an administrative user of the website.

2. The note taker saves the notes in docx format and sends the notes out to all 
   of the stakeholders.

3. If a stakeholder has changes to make they will either:

    1. Turn on track changes, make edits to the document, save the document as 
       a docx, and email the file back to the note taker, or

    2. Raise their concerns at the next meeting.

4. At the next meeting, all stakeholders will be asked if they have any objections 
   to making the notes public. 

5. Until a quorum is reached with no objections, the notes will remain private.

6. When a quorum is reached with no objections, the administrative user will 
   save the notes as a pdf and upload them to the website via the DOCMAN feature.

    1. The files need to be uploaded into the proper location of DOCMAN. Figuring 
       out the proper location can be a time consuming process involving multiple 
       browser windows and hunting through menus.

The process for uploading proposals is very similar to the process of uploading 
meeting notes, with one difference: there is no meeting at which to take notes, 
the proposals come from stakeholders. 

It is unclear how much space these files (or the website for that matter) take 
up. Some error codes indicate that it may take up more than 128mb.

Since no visitor analytics are currently being captured, we do not know how much 
traffic this portion of the website receives monthly.

## Datetime

An important element of the website is the inclusion of dates and times of 
upcoming public meetings. Directions about how to access these meetings must be 
made available to the public by law.

NTTG also holds private meetings. For private meetings, meeting subject, date, 
time, attendees, and access information are not added to the website. This 
information is communicated privately between the relevant stakeholders.

## Cost

Records show that NTTG originally paid about $3500 to get the site built by 
eVenture. At the time, they were hosting the site via SiteGround for $7/month. 
They were paying the hosting fees annually for $84.40/year.

The 2011 website assessment showed that the hosting costs had raised to $107/year.

The 2013 hosting invoice shows that hosting was still through SiteGround at the 
time and was being paid monthly at $15.39/month. This works out to an annual 
cost of $184.68/year for hosting.

Hosting is still through SiteGround. The Joomla platform running on the 
SiteGround Apache servers is currently free of charge.

# Navigating the Site

All interviewed users demonstrate difficulty in navigating nttg.biz. Even users
who have been instrumental in developing the organization of the website spend 
time hunting for content in a different place than where it is actually located.

While there are multiple ways to make another pass at finding the info the user
is looking for, few users made use of all options before giving up. Fewer still
were able to successfully locate the information they sought using these alternate
methods. 

Often, the information users are looking for is nested several levels deep. For
example, locating the final draft of the 2012-2013 NTTG Cost Allocation report
can take six clicks to access:

1. Click on **NTTG Committees** in the main menu.
2. Scroll down to the links within the **Cost Allocation** section and click
   The **FERC Order 890 Cost Allocation Process** link.
3. Click on the **Cost Allocation Process 2012-2013** category.
4. Click on the **2012-2013 Cost Allocation Report Development**.
5. Click on the **2012-2013 NTTG Cost Allocation Report Final** link to initiate 
   downloading a PDF.
6. Click on the downloaded PDF file to open it and view the contents.

## Observed Methods for Additional Attempts to Locate Content

We observed four different methods employed to attempt to locate content after
not finding it at the expected location.

It is worth noting that none of our users used the **[ Back ]** link at the 
bottom of any of the nttg.biz pages.

### Breadcrumbs

![Breadcrumbs on nttg.biz reflect the nested folder organization of available files, not the path traveled to arrive at the present location.](img/breadcrumbs.png)



### Main Menu

### Documents

### Site Search
* uses the breadcrumbs to step up a level or two,
* returns to the top-level categories in the main menu,
* drills through the folders in the **Documents** section, or
* uses the embedded site search.

Currently, search only allows queries that are 20 characters long or less. This
length is less than adequate for searching for a phrase like "public policy 
requirements" (a 25 character query).

They try and keep content accessible in three ways: drilling down through the 
main menu, nested folders in the **Documents** section, and site search. The
most recent items are also available though the quick links in the **Recently
Posted Items** section.
# Document Biases

The information we've gathered has been heavily reliant on the user studies 
conducted with administrative users. To better understand the needs of other 
user types, we suggest conducting additional user studies with private access 
users (if such users exist) and public users.

An important part of additional user studies will be finding and observing 
private access users. Since this is a group that is largely ignored in current 
administrative practices, learning about the needs and expectations of these 
users is likely to result in a significant improvement in their experience with 
the site.
