# Technology

Amy accesses the admin side of nttg.biz via IE 9. For everything else she does 
in her day, she uses Chrome.

# File Uploading Process 

As Amy sees it, nttg.biz is more about document storage than information 
dissemination.

To upload files, she opens both the front-end and the admin access to refresh 
the front-end. She uploads documents from her computer onto the website via the 
admin interface. Amy gets the documents via email from Sharon.

When meeting notes have been approved, she converts them to PDF and uploads 
them to the website.

To figure out where to upload new committee meeting files, she goes to **Documents** 
on the main menu, opens the **Steering Committee Meetings** category, opens the 
**Steering Committee Meeting Material** category, and then opens the appropriate 
date category. 

She uses the breadcrumbs presented on the front-end to help guide her to the 
same location on the admin interface. Once there, she creates a new doc entry.

This process means that a new category is created for each committee meeting.

# Recently Posted

The last five posted items appear in the **Recently Posted Items** section at the 
top of each page. In order to add items to this list, the administrator must
manually create an entry.

Items that make it into the Recently Posted Items list include "whatever is 
important." Examples of important items are meeting notes and agendas.

# Adding Stakeholder Meetings

The admin has to run through an elaborate process of copying & pasting existing 
text to keep the formatting for each meeting the same. She then edits the link
and the text in the copied text.

# Browser Support

Amy uses IE 9 to make her edits because this site does not support modern browsers.

When she attempts to make edits via a modern browser (like Chrome), popups that
are neccessary for saving changes never load.

This lack of modern browser support could result in the inability to update the 
site in the future.

# Nesting Limitations

As part of her process for adding content, the admin creates a **Content Item** 
within a **Category**. The Content Item is the equivalent of page content, and so
is unable to nest further within it. 

In other words, the admin is unable to nest content items within content items. 
Instead, the nesting has to be faked through redirects to items stored in the
Recently Posted list.

# Deprecated Features

This was a feature that was implemented a for a short time, but elicited a lot
of concern from the funders. They felt it opened them up to legal issues.

# Files Uploaded

The following files get uploaded to the site:

* PDFs (most of the content)
* DOCX (content for stakeholders to work with)
* XSLX (content for stakeholders to work with)

# Unused Features

There are a couple of features that the admin doesn't make much use of

* Hot!
* User Administration
* Registration to sign up to the distribution list

## Hot! 

Doesn't really know what this is or does. It doesn't affect anything that she's
doing though.

## User Administration 

Amy and Pam are the only people with user accounts that Amy recognizes. All 
other registered users are assumed to be spam. 

There are currently 18258 registered users. These registered users fit our 
definition of the **Private Access Users**, although none are currently seeing 
any benefit from being a registered user.

## Registration to sign up to the distribution list

Registering for the distribution list creates a new users account. These users 
are the **Private Access Users**. NTTG does not use any of these registrations 
to distribute information, although the text on the website would indicate 
otherwise:

> Registering with nttg.biz will add the users to the NTTG distribution list,
> giving them up-to-date information on public stakeholder meetings.

Site administrators don't have a way to validate email addresses, don't curate 
the list, or move any of the user data into a CRM service. No newsletters are
distributed to registered users.

Instead, in order to _actually_ get access to newsletter updates, interested 
parties need to contact Sharon or an administrator directly and request to be
added to the list.

# State Desire for a Stable Platform

For Amy, this means that the website shouldn't go down due to content updates 
and the site should be viewable and editable from multiple browsers.
