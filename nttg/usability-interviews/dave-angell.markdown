# Primary Use

Access to meetings (meetings he's attending, meetings he's leading).

## Workflow

Goes to the calendar and looks for the upcoming meeting. 

After finding the meeting, he'll download and open the agenda document to refer 
to for the meeting. Sometimes he'll print it out (like when he's traveling), 
other times he'll view it on his computer.

He also wants the meeting materials, which he accesses by clicking on the 
**Link to Meeting Materials** hyperlink in the agenda document. This brings him
to the Documents folder on nttg.biz for this meeting's materials.

## Difficulties

The organization of the calendar causes a little bit of confusion each time he 
goes to use it. He expects a calendar to be laid out as SMTWTFS, but the NTTG
calendar is MTWTFSS.

Additionally, Dave sometimes has trouble finding the meeting he's looking for.
When this happens, he uses the meeting categories at the bottom of the calendar
view to filter to a category of events. This returns a long list of meetings 
within that category (sorted in ascending order). He's usually looking for a 
recent meeting though, and the list is long enough that it isn't immediately 
visible. So, he'll try hunting through the calendar again.

## Receiving Notice about Upcoming Meetings

He get's an email from Sharon when there is a meeting coming up. If he's got a
new member of his team that he'd like to be notified as well, he'll tell Sharon
to add the team member to the list.

# Looking for Documents

Dave isn't always looking for meetings, sometimes he's looking for documents.

## Finding the Charter

> If I'm not coming in [to the NTTG website] relative to a meeting, I might be
> in here looking for some sort of document. There's a couple different ways to
> get at documents, but the first thing that strikes me is "Charters & Agreements."
>
> Often times during the Planning Committee meeting I may need to reference the 
> Charter (which I do have stored on my computer, or printed out, or I could
> come in here ... [and get] the most recent one. I know I can always get the 
> most recent charter by going back to the Charters & Agreements.

## Finding the Study Plan

First try is through **NTTG Committees**. "It isn't really an 890 process," but 
that's where he goes looking first anyway. He was expecting to see a link to 
the Order 1000 Process documents from the committees, but it wasn't listed.

> So, I'm going to go back. Because, that wasn't helpful.

The second try through he tries the **NTTG Order 1000 Process** in the main menu.
He drills into **NTTG Order 1000 Regional Planning and Cost Allocation Process** 
and looks over the options it returns, a list of the different things that 
occur in the process.

> I'm not exactly sure where I'm going to find my Study Plan based on those two
> things.

On the third try, he goes to **Documents** and then **NTTG Committees** > 
**Planning** > **FERC Order 1000 Process** > **2014-2015 NTTG Planning Cycle**.
Inside that folder, he expects to find the study plan. He finds it in 
**Quarter 2 - Data Evaluation and Study Plan Development**. 

> So I _was_ there, but I didn't understand that I had documents available on
> the last process I was looking at.
> 
> [...] The thing that was a little bit misleading on that one is that it didn't
> reflect that there were documents I could see. When I came in through the 
> Documents, I could see how many files where there.

## Finding ATC Information

He finds this information quickly (through the link on the main menu). Often 
accessed files include the ATC Summary and the ATC POR POD Map. He uses the 
ATC Summary to find out what transmission capacity is available on other systems.
He uses the ATC POR POD Map to understand where he could schedule to in other
facilities.

## Finding Previously Created (Abandoned) Documents

He uses these documents as a reference for where the committee was.

To look for these, he'll go to **Documents** > **General** > **Archived Documents**
**Order 890**, and then not find what he's looking for. He spends some time 
looking around in the general archives before deciding that he's not going to 
find what he's looking for there.

He's not even sure that it is still on the website: "What I'm looking for may
not even be on here any more." He struggles trying to find it:

> I suppose I could the search engine, but I'd have to remember any sort of 
> name of what the document is, but I don't... Let me think if I can remember
> some of the names of the documents.

He tries searching once, without success. He gives up afterward, assuming that 
the document is no longer on the site.

# Adding Content to the Site

As a committee chair, Dave creates information that needs to go up onto the site.
To get it up there, he emails it to a site administrator.

The files he'll put up are PDFs, DOCXs and PPTs. The PowerPoint files are for
meeting presentations.

## Creating Content with Subcommittees

Subcommittees are non-public, but are still working on creating documents and 
solving problems. Dave would like to have a place where the members of his 
subcommittees could collaborate. 

Idaho Power has a SharePoint site hosted in O365 that he's tried to use for this
purpose, but hasn't been very successful in getting the subcommittee members 
to adopt it as a practice. Some folks (especially legal) won't do it at all.

Instead, collaboration tends to happen through emailing documents around (with 
multiple people having multiple changes, and somebody trying to merge those 
changes).

To organize meetings for the subcommittees, Amy emails a date and time to all of 
the subcommittee members and how to connect.
