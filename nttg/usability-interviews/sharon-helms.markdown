# Technology

Sharon only accesses the front-end of nttg.biz. She uses Chrome for this.

To make updates (archiving old charters, adding content, or reorganizing the 
information architecture), Sharon calls or emails Amy and instructs Amy to do
it.

# Navigating the Site

The site has been organized to suit Sharon's preferences. Usually, this means 
that Sharon has a sense of where she needs to go and which folders she needs
to drill down through in order to get to the information she is seeking. However,
she often finds herself hunting for information where it isn't actually located.

To back out of dead ends and make another pass at finding the info she's looking 
for, Sharon 

* uses the breadcrumbs to step up a level or two,
* returns to the top-level categories in the main menu,
* drills through the folders in the **Documents** section, or
* uses the embedded site search.

Often, the information Sharon is looking for is nested several levels deep.

Currently, search only allows queries that are 20 characters long or less. This
length is less than adequate for searching for a phrase like "public policy 
requirements" (a 25 character query).

They try and keep content accessible in three ways: drilling down through the 
main menu, nested folders in the **Documents** section, and site search. The
most recent items are also available though the quick links in the **Recently
Posted Items** section.

# Archiving Documents

Old documents are archived as Sharon requests them to be. There is not an 
established process for determining which documents are worthy of archiving.

To archive, Sharon will contact Amy. They'll then talk about how they want to
handle a specific archiving task together.

# Public Meetings and the Calendar

The calendar is for listing public meeting notices for the stakeholder meetings 
and the steering committee meetings. Notice of upcoming meetings must be posted
at least 7 days in advance.

# Content

The majority of the content on the website is downloadable PDFs. There is a 
small collection of downloadable DOCXs and XSLXs as well. It is important that
the majority of the content is PDF so that it cannot be easily changed by end 
users and can be saved locally and printed out.

> Downloading is important for maintaining open access.

The DOCX files are used for forms to be filled out. Filled out forms are emailed
to Sharon/Amy.

# Stated Desire for a Stable Platform

Sharon recognizes that the platform that nttg.biz is built on is very old. She's 
concerned that things may break due to its age: 

> We built this in 2007 when NTTG was formed and we've done no maintenance to 
> it since then. 
>
> How long can you use Joomla 1.0 when its up to whatever it is now? [...] If
> one day it goes away and goes BOOM, we really can't be down for the period of
> time it would take to build a new website.

She also notes that in 2013 her hosting provider upgraded their servers, which 
temporarily brought nttg.biz down due to a compatibility issue. 

Additionally, the site has been hacked. Sharon would like to limit the possibility
of this happening again.

# Website Analytics

For analytics, the only current example is the "Hits" marker on individual 
documents. It shows how many times people have accessed the document.

> It just gives me some sense - particularly if we're putting something that's
> controversial out there - I like to go monitor that [to see if it has attracted
> public attention].

# Budget

NTTG is estimating a budget up to about $20,000 for this project.
